        "The traditional predictive maintenance machine learning models are based on feature engineering which is manual construction of right features using domain expertise and similar methods. This usually makes these models hard to reuse since feature engineering is specific to the problem scenario and the available data which varies from one business to the other. Perhaps the most attractive part of applying deep learning in the predictive maintenance domain is the fact that these networks can automatically extract the right features from the data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.\n",

        "he idea of using LSTMs is to let the model extract abstract features out of the sequence of sensor values in the window rather than engineering those manually. The expectation is that if there is a pattern in these sensor values within the window prior to failure, the pattern should be encoded by the LSTM.\n",
        "\n",
        "One critical advantage of LSTMs is their ability to remember from long-term sequences (window sizes) which is hard to achieve by traditional feature engineering. For example, computing rolling averages over a window size of 50 cycles may lead to loss of information due to smoothing and abstracting of values over such a long period, instead, using all 50 values as input may provide better results. While feature engineering over large window sizes may not make sense, LSTMs are able to use larger window sizes and use all the information in the window as input. \n",
